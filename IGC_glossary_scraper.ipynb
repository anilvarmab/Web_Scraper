      "[<p>Federal law prohibits federal funds, including Marketplace premium tax credits, from being used for abortion services except in the limited cases of rape, incest, or if a woman suffers from a life-threatening physical injury or illness that would place the woman in danger of death unless an abortion is performed. Marketplace health plans may cover abortion services in different ways:</p>, <p>A group of health care providers who give coordinated care, chronic disease management, and thereby improve the quality of care patients get. The organization's payment is tied to achieving health care quality goals and outcomes that result in cost savings.</p>, <p>If a Marketplace health plan is approved, this is the “seal of approval” given to the plan by an independent organization to show that the plan meets national quality standards.</p>, <p>The percentage of total average costs for covered benefits that a plan will cover. For example, if a plan has an actuarial value of 70%, on average, you would be responsible for 30% of the costs of all covered benefits. However, you could be responsible for a higher or lower percentage of the total costs of covered services for the year, depending on your actual health care needs and the terms of your insurance policy.</p>, <p>Your total (or “gross”) income for the tax year, minus certain adjustments you’re allowed to take. Adjustments include deductions for conventional IRA contributions, student loan interest, and more. Adjusted gross income appears on IRS Form 1040, line 7.</p>, <p>A tax credit you can take in advance to lower your monthly health insurance payment (or “premium”). When you apply for coverage in the Health Insurance Marketplace, you estimate your expected income for the year. If you qualify for a premium tax credit based on your estimate, you can use any amount of the credit in advance to lower your premium.</p>, <p>The comprehensive health care reform law enacted in March 2010 (sometimes known as ACA, PPACA, or “Obamacare”).</p>, <p>A job-based health plan covering only the employee that costs 9.86% or less of the employee’s household income. If a job-based plan is “affordable,” and meets the “minimum value” standard, you're not eligible for a premium tax credit if you buy a Marketplace insurance plan instead.</p>, <p>A trained insurance professional who can help you enroll in a health insurance plan. Agents may work for a single health insurance company; brokers may represent several companies. You won’t pay anything additional if you enroll with an agent or broker.</p>, <p>Alimony is money you get from a spouse with whom you no longer live, or a former spouse, if paid to you as part of a divorce agreement, separation agreement, or court order. Payments designated in the agreement or order as child support or as a non-taxable property settlement aren’t alimony.</p>, <p>The maximum amount a plan will pay for a covered health care service. May also be called “eligible expense,” “payment allowance,” or “negotiated rate.”</p>, <p>Usually in Health Savings Account (HSA) eligible plans, the total amount that family members on a plan must pay out-of-pocket for health care or prescription drugs before the health plan begins to pay.</p>, <p>A cap on the benefits your insurance company will pay in a year while you're enrolled in a particular health insurance plan. These caps are sometimes placed on particular services such as prescriptions or hospitalizations. Annual limits may be placed on the dollar amount of covered services or on the number of visits that will be covered for a particular service. After an annual limit is reached, you must pay all associated health care costs for the rest of the year.</p>, <p>A request for your health insurance company or the Health Insurance Marketplace to review a decision that denies a benefit or payment.</p>, <p>Each Marketplace application has a unique identification number, or Application ID. After you apply for Marketplace coverage, you’ll get a notice with your eligibility results that contains your Application ID. You'll need your Application ID to continue with an existing application, compare plans, and complete enrollment. If you are doing this by phone, you can provide your Application ID to the Marketplace Call Center representative so they can find your application faster. If you're continuing your application, comparing plans, and enrolling online, you'll be asked to enter your Application ID after you log in to your account and select \"Find my existing application.\"</p>, <p>When you apply for health coverage through the Marketplace, you're required to agree (or \"attest\") to the truth of the information provided by signing the application.</p>, <p>Someone who you choose to act on your behalf with the Marketplace, like a family member or other trusted person. Some authorized representatives may have legal authority to act on your behalf.</p>, <p>When a provider bills you for the difference between the provider’s charge and the allowed amount. For example, if the provider’s charge is $100 and the allowed amount is $70, the provider may bill you for the remaining $30. A preferred provider may not balance bill you for covered services.</p>, <p>A year of benefits coverage under an individual health insurance plan. The benefit year for plans bought inside or outside the Marketplace begins January 1 of each year and ends December 31 of the same year. Your coverage ends December 31 even if your coverage started after January 1. Any changes to benefits or rates to a health insurance plan are made at the beginning of the calendar year.</p>, <p>The health care items or services covered under a health insurance plan. Covered benefits and excluded services are defined in the health insurance plan's coverage documents. In Medicaid or CHIP, covered benefits and excluded services are defined in state program rules.</p>, <p>The generic version of more complicated medications.</p>, <p>A drug sold by a drug company under a specific name or trademark and that is protected by a patent. Brand name drugs may be available by prescription or over the counter.</p>, <p>An agent or broker is a person or business who can help you apply for help paying for coverage and enroll in a Qualified Health Plan (QHP) through the Marketplace. They can make specific recommendations about which plan you should enroll in. They’re also licensed and regulated by states and typically get payments, or commissions, from health insurers for enrolling a consumer into an issuer's plans. Some brokers may only be able to sell plans from specific health insurers.</p>, <p>One of 4 plan categories (also known as “metal levels”) in the Health Insurance Marketplace. Bronze plans usually have the lowest monthly premiums but the highest costs when you get care. They can be a good choice if you usually use few medical services and mostly want protection from very high costs if you get seriously sick or injured.</p>, <p>A federal law that may allow you to temporarily keep health coverage after your employment ends, you lose coverage as a dependent of the covered employee, or another qualifying event. If you elect COBRA (Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act) coverage, you pay 100% of the premiums, including the share the employer used to pay, plus a small administrative fee.</p>, <p>A cafeteria plan is a separate written plan maintained by an employer for employees that meets the specific requirements and regulations of Section 125 of the Internal Revenue Code. It provides participants an opportunity to receive certain benefits on a pretax basis. Participants in a cafeteria plan must be permitted to choose among at least one taxable benefit (such as cash) and one qualified benefit.</p>, <p>If you incurred a debt from a loan or from buying something on credit and a portion of the amount you owe is discharged or forgiven (\"canceled\"), the amount of the forgiven debt is generally counted as income to you.</p>, <p>A capital gain is the amount you get from selling property, like stock, a house, or a mutual fund. For example, if you buy stock for $1,000 and sell it for $1,250, you have capital gain of $250. You don't need to include a capital gain if it's from the sale of your main home you owned for at least 5 years (and the profit is less than $250,000). Report any capital gains noted in Form 1099-DIV, which you should get from some companies, like mutual funds, before the tax filing deadline.</p>, <p>The organization of your treatment across several health care providers. Medical homes and Accountable Care Organizations are two common ways to coordinate care.</p>, <p>Health plans that meet all of the requirements applicable to other Qualified Health Plans (QHPs) but that don't cover any benefits other than 3 primary care visits per year before the plan's deductible is met. The premium amount you pay each month for health care is generally lower than for other QHPs, but the out-of-pocket costs for deductibles, copayments, and coinsurance are generally higher. To qualify for a Catastrophic plan, you must be under 30 years old OR get a \"hardship exemption\" because the Marketplace determined that you’re unable to afford health coverage.</p>, <p>The federal agency that runs the Medicare, Medicaid, and Children's Health Insurance Programs, and the federally facilitated Marketplace. For more information, visit <a href=\"http://www.cms.gov/\">cms.gov</a>.</p>, <p>An individual (affiliated with a designated organization) who is trained and able to help consumers, small businesses, and their employees as they look for health coverage options through the Marketplace, including helping them complete eligibility and enrollment forms. Their services are free to consumers.</p>, <p>Insurance program that provides low-cost health coverage to children in families that earn too much money to qualify for Medicaid but not enough to buy private insurance. In some states, CHIP covers pregnant women.</p>, <p>An integrated care approach to managing illness which includes screenings, check-ups, monitoring and coordinating treatment, and patient education. It can improve your quality of life while reducing your health care costs if you have a chronic disease by preventing or minimizing the effects of a disease.</p>, <p>A request for payment that you or your health care provider submits to your health insurer when you get items or services you think are covered.</p>, <p>A non-profit organization in which the same people who own the company are insured by the company. Cooperatives can be formed at a national, state, or local level and can include doctors, hospitals, and businesses as member-owners.

For example, some plans have never gone through the accreditation process or have gone through the process with a different accrediting organization. Other plans are too new to be accredited or have started but not finished the accreditation process. Not being accredited doesn't mean that a plan is lower quality than a plan that's accredited.</p>, <p>An official form of communication that informs individuals about the status of their applications, their eligibility for programs, or other important information.
